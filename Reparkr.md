# Reparkr

## Project Description
Reparkr is a decentralized repark-request system built on Starknet. It lets car owners register their plate numbers as on-chain identities, and enables other drivers to send privacy-preserving repark requests when they are blocked. The system solves the common urban problem of cars being blocked by others, providing a seamless way to contact vehicle owners without revealing personal information.
